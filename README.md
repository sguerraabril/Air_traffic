This project analyzes and connects three datasets on air transporation: airports, routes, and continents; with the goal of providing graphical information about them. It uses geographical coordinates about airports as well as extense data on the routes that connect them to answer questions about popular airports, airlines, or types of routes. The results are performed in this [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/sguerraabril/Valencian-streets/blob/main/Calles%20Valencia%20Velocidad.ipynb).
